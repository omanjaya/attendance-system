2. **Employee management (CRUD)** for all staff types
3. **Period management** (class periods, break times, etc.)
4. **Teacher schedule management** with flexible hour assignments
5. **School schedule management** (holidays, events, calendar)
6. **Leave/permit submission system** with approval workflow
7. **Flexible payroll system** (hourly vs full-time calculations)
8. **Payroll export** per employee per month
9. **Server-side data tables** using Yajra DataTables
10. **AJAX operations** (PUT, POST, GET, DELETE) throughout
11. **Spatie permission system** for granular role management
12. **Page-level access control** with role checking before any action
13. **SQLite database** implementation
14. **Attendance radius settings** for location-based check-in
15. **Persistent login sessions** (remember me functionality)
16. **Tabler.io frontend** following official documentation

### Attendance System Focus Areas

#### Employee Types & Schedule Logic
- **Honorary Teachers**: Flexible working hours (e.g., 10 AM - 12 PM)
  - Must clock in BEFORE scheduled start time to avoid "late" status
  - Payroll calculated ONLY for actual working hours within schedule
  - Example: Schedule 10 AM-12 PM, arrives 8 AM, leaves 1 PM â†’ paid for 10 AM-12 PM only
- **Permanent Teachers**: Fixed working hours with full-day calculations
- **Permanent Staff**: Fixed working hours with full-day calculations  
- **Honorary Staff**: Flexible hours similar to honorary teachers

#### Advanced Face Detection Requirements
- **Primary**: Face recognition for identity verification
- **Gesture Detection**: Head shaking, head nodding, smiling, blinking
- **Anti-spoofing**: Liveness detection through gesture combinations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all face detection attempts

#### Location & Schedule Management
- **Radius-based attendance**: GPS/location verification for valid check-ins
- **Dynamic schedule assignment**: Different schedules per employee type
- **Real-time validation**: Immediate feedback on attendance status

## Critical Implementation Requirements

### Security & Permission System
```php
// Every controller action must check permissions:
public function index()
{
    $this->authorize('view-employees');
    // Controller logic
}

// Middleware for route protection:
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'permission:manage-schedules'])
    ->group(function () {
        // Protected routes
    });
```

### Attendance Logic for Honorary Teachers
```php
// Example: Honorary teacher scheduled 10 AM - 12 PM
// Arrives: 8 AM, Leaves: 1 PM
// Payroll calculation: Only 10 AM - 12 PM (2 hours)
class AttendanceCalculator
{
    public function calculatePayableHours($employee, $checkIn, $checkOut)
    {
        if ($employee->type === 'honorary_teacher') {
            // Calculate intersection of actual hours with scheduled hours
            return $this->getScheduledHoursIntersection($employee, $checkIn, $checkOut);
        }
        // For permanent employees, different logic
    }
}
```

### Face Detection with Gestures
```python
# FastAPI endpoint for gesture detection
@app.post("/detect-gestures")
async def detect_gestures(image: UploadFile):
    # Detect face
    # Analyze facial landmarks for nod/shake
    # Check for smile using expression analysis
    # Detect blink using eye aspect ratio
    return {
        "face_detected": True,
        "gestures": {
            "nod": True,
            "shake": False,
            "smile": True,
            "blink": True
        },
        "liveness_score": 0.95
    }
```

### Tabler.io Implementation Standard
```vue
<!-- All components must follow Tabler.io documentation -->
<template>
  <div class="page">
    <div class="page-header d-print-none">
      <div class="container-xl">
        <div class="row g-2 align-items-center">
          <div class="col">
            <h2 class="page-title">Employee Management</h2>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Use Tabler.io table classes -->
    <div class="page-body">
      <div class="container-xl">
        <div class="card">
          <div class="table-responsive">
            <table class="table table-vcenter card-table">
              <!-- Server-side DataTables integration -->
            </table>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```
